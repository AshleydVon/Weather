# Weather Dashboard

## Description

The Weather Dashboard is a web application that allows users to view current and future weather conditions for multiple cities. The application uses the [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) from OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data and dynamically updates the HTML and CSS to display the information.
